#To define the direction of the output to file instead of terminal use the sink() function.
#By default sink() overwrites existing file and there is no output to the terminal.
#sink(“output script file”)
## return output to the terminal 
# sink()
#To append output to the file and direct output both to the terminal and to the terminal use
#sink(“output script file”, append=TRUE, split=TRUE)

#So type in the script editor
sink("output script file”)

#run and find the output file i.e. ‘output script file’, after that 
#type sink(), to return to the terminal and type something like that:
